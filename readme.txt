Version control, to me, is all about managing and organizing the various iterations of my code and project files. It allows me to monitor changes over time, work seamlessly with others, and easily roll back to earlier versions whenever necessary. This means I no longer need to create separate backup copies each time I make significant updates. Overall, version control is a crucial tool for keeping projects structured, efficient, and collaborative.
